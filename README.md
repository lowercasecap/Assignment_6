I made an original attempt at solving the assignment which is in the zip folder. And after the due I decided to take another crack at the assignment which 
was just as difficult, but I found a working implementation online that accurately runs matrix multiplication in parallel using OpenCL. This file is labeled opencl_matrix_mul.

Thank You
